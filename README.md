# Falling-Object

This project is meant to represent a falling object game, where the object falls from the top of the screen at random speed intervals and random locations. The user can move the character at the bottom of the screen from left to right and vice versa using the left and right arrows of the keyboard.

The project was implemented using C. It is best to test it using a cpulator with a VGA pixel buffer and PS/2 keybaord input. You could use: https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc. Make sure to change the language to C at the top before uplaoding the file, as shown in the picture:

Look for the VGA buffer and PS/2 keyboard in the Devices, located at the right of the screen. Load the file, compile it and run it. You should place your mouse as the picture shown to make use of the keyboard and be able to move the character left or right:
